      papers. For the content, we are still using excerpts of <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages">the previous article</a>. No illustrations are allowed. However, you can treat your typography as
      an image. In addition, think about the contrast and harmony of your typeface pairing. Also, even though we're only using two colors, think about using black as white and white as black and also black/white gradients. Can you use drop shadows?
      Can you use inner/outer glow? Can you use bevel/emboss?<br><br>

Only basic shapes are allowed to be integrated to the poster (circles, lines, triangles, etc.). You can also try to use parts of the letters to create illustrations. This time, you can use color.

The title should be one you have already read or can easily find information about by reading reviews, etc. Before you begin the design phase, you will research about it first. Do they use imagery and illustrations on the cover? Are there common visual themes? How is the color utilized to convey emotion? How are visual tropes utilized? Do you think the approach is original? Are there any instances where you feel there is a disconnect between content and design?  How do the cover designs compare with other books by the same author, or other books in the same genre?

Choose the design direction that has the most potential. Refine and update your design according to any feedback received during your final critique. Now, the design should include: a) spine (1 inch wide with publisher logo, author, and book title) and b) back cover (with barcode, pricing information, and book description).<br>

Over the next couple of weeks, create a printed booklet with texts that further expand and explore those ideas in this medium. For the first process, for next week, bring 3 - 5 texts that are thematically or conceptually linked in some ways to your previous works and these will comprise the primary content of your booklet. Your booklet could revolve around a particular subject, object, event, or person. Or you could take a more process-based and indirect approach, identifying one or two key texts that are significant influences, and build a collection around them. The texts might include but are not limited to: essays, interviews, short stories, manifestos, screenplays, poetry, diary entries, letters, recipes, emails, text messages, or a combination thereof, but think of them as a set.<br><br>

        - Small group critique<br>
        - Introduce 2nd process of <div class="project">Project 05, Personalized Anthology</div>. Most book forms exist in relation to a certain typology (typography and format) each devised for different genres of context, and evolved in response to ergonomic, technological, and economic needs and wants. Some examples: fiction -> paperback, academic writing -> journal, monograph -> catalog, lists -> phone book/dictionary/menu, religious scripture -> prayer book, daily news -> newspaper. As you begin the design of your booklet, ground your approach in relation to a typology, or perhaps a hybrid of two typologies (e.g. newspaper typography in a paperback size, etc.), but no more. For the second process, I want you to use one of your texts to design two different page layouts (as spreads) that articulate the page size, text blocks, page numbers, footnotes, and running heads (if desired) and print them. Do not include imagery or headlines at this stage. Explore the compositional tension and balance within a page and across a spread (e.g. symmetry vs. asymmetry and combinations thereof). Experiment with all the traditional variables: page and text block sizes/ratios, type size, tracking, leading, word spacing, paragraph breaks, etc. Don't take anything for granted.<br><br>

        - Introduce 3rd process of <div class="project">Project 05, Personalized Anthology</div>. From the layouts you designed, design 4-8 separate spreads (now including section breaks and imagery) which give us a sense of the overall visual grammar and textual content of your booklet. At this stage, do not design the cover or table of content (if you plan to include one). Decide whether it makes sense for your section breaks to take up an entire spread (dramatic, luxurious), one page (a little less so), a half-page or quarter-page (functional, conventional), or less (efficient). Do your texts start on the left or right side of the page or do they alternate as needed? What does the title typography look like and connote? Is it formal/informal, minimal/ornate, systemized/irregular? Ask yourself why in each instance. Then switch your attention to different ways of incorporating imagery and color (optional) into your booklet to make it more image- and information-rich. The imagery should build on strategies already developed in your spread, so that the posters and booklet feel related visually, part of a visual/verbal argument. Also, be cautious when introducing color since it could make or break your existing booklet structure (that's why it's optional). When I said imagery, imagery could be incorporated in innumerable ways; as background texture, as a decorative frame, as captions, as an isolated image on a page, intricately integrated with the text, at a distance from its reference, etc. Likewise, the imagery could function in different ways; abstractly in response to ideas in each text or overarching themes, or figuratively, illustrating specific references in the text. Your goal should be to devise a coherent strategy for your use of imagery as a whole.<br><br>

          My experience with misspellings and typos is privileged. I am able to navigate language, for instance, without a disability; I am also able to navigate this world with English as my first language. The control that allows me to go without
          autocorrect, the ability to manipulate language according to my meaning, is a particular experience of language. There will always be those for whom certain spelling mistakes and grammatical errors are never deliberate, nor easy to
          associate with art or poetry. Autocorrect and spell check cannot hold the language of my parents, whose use of a hybrid of Tagalog and English is a reminder of being first generation. Autocorrect tries to grasp the birthday messages and
          occasional check-in’s — “hapi bday ipay” and “ask your mom if we gonna have facetime. miss ka na” — that my relatives from the Philippines leave on my Facebook inbox, always a reminder of the distance between us. Algorithms can ease the
          embarrassment and shame that comes with being always self-conscious about spelling, grammar, and the dread of making mistakes.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>

          My partner and I have taken to sending each other text messages informed by the predictive function of our phones, allowing us to break away from the conventions of sentence formation, in ways that can seem truer to what’s being expressed.
          We are drawn to this function’s revealing nature — how the word options are a palette uniquely our own — and the unravelling feeling of relying solely on our own algorithms and data to say what we mean, however senseless it may be: “Hi Pam
          I’m sorry for being so cute but I’m not even gonna do anything with your hair until you see my face;” or “Hi Hudson I hope you’re having the best week ever thank you for being so cute and nice to me and you can make my day feel better with
          your hair today;” or “Goodnight I love this day and I hope it feels better now to be able to sleep and sleep well I love your sleep goodnight partner.” Each composition is fragmentary of all the messages we have ever written and

          Like autocorrect and spell check, the predictive function that runs in our chat logs is made up of algorithms that anticipate what we mean to say before we communicate it, as if you have fed and shaped your phone’s capabilities according to
          your own preference, style, form — a unique imprint. What makes us ourselves, then, presents itself in multiple minute details: all-lowercase, for instance, refined by adapting the vernaculars of the internet voice, age, and culture; run-on
          sentences lacking any sort of punctuation marks or inhibition, because urgency and exasperation have exhausted the limits of contained speech; in misspellings and typos, because the right words are not enough.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>
