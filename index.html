      papers. For the content, we are still using excerpts of <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages">the previous article</a>. No illustrations are allowed. However, you can treat your typography as
      an image. In addition, think about the contrast and harmony of your typeface pairing. Also, even though we're only using two colors, think about using black as white and white as black and also black/white gradients. Can you use drop shadows?
      Can you use inner/outer glow? Can you use bevel/emboss?<br><br>

The poster should contain: a) name of the typeface, b) name of the typeface designer, c) year it was created, d) one or two paragraphs about the typeface, and e) full character set (letters, numbers, and punctuations). Only basic shapes are allowed to be integrated to the poster (circles, lines, triangles, etc.). You can also try to use parts of the letters to create illustrations. This time, you can use color. If you chose a display typeface, you can pair it with another typeface as its body text.</a>

The title should be one you have already read or can easily find information about by reading reviews, etc. Before you begin the design phase, you will research about it first. Do they use imagery and illustrations on the cover? Are there common visual themes? How is the color utilized to convey emotion? How are visual tropes utilized? Do you think the approach is original? Are there any instances where you feel there is a disconnect between content and design?  How do the cover designs compare with other books by the same author, or other books in the same genre?

Choose the design direction that has the most potential. Refine and update your design according to any feedback received during your final critique. Now, the design should include: a) spine (1 inch wide with publisher logo, author, and book title) and b) back cover (with barcode, pricing information, and book description).<br>

Your booklet could revolve around a particular subject, object, event, or person. Or you could take a more process-based and indirect approach, identifying one or two key texts that are significant influences, and build a collection around them. The texts might include but are not limited to: essays, interviews, short stories, manifestos, screenplays, poetry, diary entries, letters, recipes, emails, text messages, or a combination thereof, but think of them as a set.<br><br>

          In his poem, “we suspekt each other uv nowing how to spell the word informashun,” bill bissett explains why his own work adapts traditional English orthography to accommodate the rhythms of speech and the way we talk. He writes:

          His resistance to conforming to proper grammar and spelling is political. Why are proper spelling and grammar considered the standards for quality of expression, he asks, when “90% uv th world dusint spell correctly” — as if grammatical
          proficiency were a marker of someone’s intelligence and worth? Screen-mediated communication makes obvious this bias. A good texter is aware of the rhythm of their sentences (when to stop and when to keep going), the pacing required with
          punctuation (or a lack thereof). They are willing to go beyond basic sentence formations to make their meaning and expression clearer to the recipient. In the same way that Emin’s misspellings and typos emphasize an unfiltering of her
          emotions, bissett writes how he talks and how he feels, resisting the “problems n inhibishuns with xpressyun” that are bound to language and a page.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>

          I think of the deliberate ways my friends and I choose to express ourselves in text: There is a difference, for example, between “dumb” and “dum”: one is unintelligible, and the other is unintelligibly endearing. The misspelling of “in two
          secs” as “in two sex” becomes an inside joke, part of a private language; we express our excitement in all caps, sometimes ignoring the conventions of grammar because “OMG????????” conveys more than just “omg!” For Emin, misspellings and
          typos are signifiers of emotional undoing; bissett’s phonetic devices are tone and voice, adapted to his own expressions rather than the extraneous rules of grammar. In both cases, misspellings indicate presence and voice — a “human touch”
          — and say something about the embodied ways we communicate textually, whether in art, poetry, or SMS.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>

          My experience with misspellings and typos is privileged. I am able to navigate language, for instance, without a disability; I am also able to navigate this world with English as my first language. The control that allows me to go without
          autocorrect, the ability to manipulate language according to my meaning, is a particular experience of language. There will always be those for whom certain spelling mistakes and grammatical errors are never deliberate, nor easy to
          associate with art or poetry. Autocorrect and spell check cannot hold the language of my parents, whose use of a hybrid of Tagalog and English is a reminder of being first generation. Autocorrect tries to grasp the birthday messages and
          occasional check-in’s — “hapi bday ipay” and “ask your mom if we gonna have facetime. miss ka na” — that my relatives from the Philippines leave on my Facebook inbox, always a reminder of the distance between us. Algorithms can ease the
          embarrassment and shame that comes with being always self-conscious about spelling, grammar, and the dread of making mistakes.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>

          My partner and I have taken to sending each other text messages informed by the predictive function of our phones, allowing us to break away from the conventions of sentence formation, in ways that can seem truer to what’s being expressed.
          We are drawn to this function’s revealing nature — how the word options are a palette uniquely our own — and the unravelling feeling of relying solely on our own algorithms and data to say what we mean, however senseless it may be: “Hi Pam
          I’m sorry for being so cute but I’m not even gonna do anything with your hair until you see my face;” or “Hi Hudson I hope you’re having the best week ever thank you for being so cute and nice to me and you can make my day feel better with
          your hair today;” or “Goodnight I love this day and I hope it feels better now to be able to sleep and sleep well I love your sleep goodnight partner.” Each composition is fragmentary of all the messages we have ever written and

          Like autocorrect and spell check, the predictive function that runs in our chat logs is made up of algorithms that anticipate what we mean to say before we communicate it, as if you have fed and shaped your phone’s capabilities according to
          your own preference, style, form — a unique imprint. What makes us ourselves, then, presents itself in multiple minute details: all-lowercase, for instance, refined by adapting the vernaculars of the internet voice, age, and culture; run-on
          sentences lacking any sort of punctuation marks or inhibition, because urgency and exasperation have exhausted the limits of contained speech; in misspellings and typos, because the right words are not enough.<br>⚠️🔩🛠️🔩⚠️</center>
